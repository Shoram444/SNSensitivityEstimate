Literature recommendation for:
	Bayessian analysis 


### Books to read: 
- Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath
	- A great book on comprehensive Bayessian analysis
	- https://xcelab.net/rm/ (Good resource website with code suggestions)
	- https://www.youtube.com/@rmcelreath/playlists (Youtube playlists of the lectures by author)

- Statistical Data Analysis by Glen Cowan 
	- Good general statistics for particle physics (not so much Bayessian, but a nice intro to Bayess Theorem)
	- https://www.sherrytowers.com/cowan_statistical_data_analysis.pdf  


### Papers:
- *NATURE* Background-free search for neutrinoless double-Î² decay of 76Ge with GERDA 
	- Methodology describes the choice of model and procedure of calculating sensitivty (I tried to follow this one as much as made sense)
	- https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21717

- A Bayesian Approach to Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Analysis in KamLAND-Zen
	- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351500787_A_Bayesian_Approach_to_Neutrinoless_Double_Beta_Decay_Analysis_in_KamLAND-Zen


- CUORE sensitivity to 0nubb decay
	- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5098-9

- Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics
	- paper on methods for sensitivty calculations (*a difficult read*)
	- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1554-0


### Tools:
- BAT (Bayessian Analysis Toolkit)
	- Developed by members of LEGEND, used extensively in other double beta experiments
	- written in Julia (a rewrite of an *old* software written in C++, I don't know it it still works..)
	- some tutorials: https://github.com/bat/bat-julia-tutorial
	- freely available at https://github.com/bat/BAT.jl (example in documentation)
	- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00626-4 (**with GERDA-like example**)

- Turing.jl
	- A general bayessian inference software
	- relatively easy learning curve (in comparison to BAT I would say)
	- Documentation with a bunch of examples: https://turinglang.org/dev/ 

### Youtube:
- Probabilistic programming for beginners
	- A very nice intro to Bayessian statistics and how Turing is used 
	- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQ2JMBcfAsgU7kZ-Ee_SDrjhJIehICmR
	- Guy also has other julia tutorials (worth checking out if interested)

- Probabilistic modelling with Turing.jl
	- A bit more comprehensive guide
